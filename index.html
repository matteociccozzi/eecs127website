</ul>
<p>Discussion material will be released on Friday.</p>
<p>Solutions to the discussion material will be released on Monday after the last discussion of the week.</p>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="homework"></a>
<p>Homework will be assigned every Friday on bCourses and will be due the following Friday at 11:00pm. Homework will be electronically submitted to Gradescope (entry code: <b>MYJ5YZ</b>) as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single PDF consisting of the following components:</li>
<ol>
    <li>Scanned handwritten work or a LaTeX file containing answers to non IPython questions </li>
    <li>A PDF of all iPython notebooks</li>
</ol>
<li>All IPython notebooks in .ipynb format</li>
</ol>

<p>You will need to select the pages associated with each question through Gradescope. Late homework will not be accepted, but to account for the vicissitudes of life, we will drop the 2 lowest homework scores from the final grade calculation.</p>
<p>Discussion and collaboration, as opposed to copying, of homework is encouraged. In other words, you are encouraged to discuss the homework with your classmates but you must write your own derivations and do your own calculations, etc. Do not hesitate to ask the professor or the GSIs for clarifications and hints for the homework problems during Homework Parties and Office hours. We encourage cooperation rather than competition.</p>
<p><b>Homework Grading</b></p>
<p>The point of homework in this class is for you to learn the material. To help you in doing this each student will grade their own homework in addition to being graded by readers. After the HW deadline, official solutions will be posted online. You will then be expected to read them and enter your own scores and comments for every part of every problem in the homework on a simple coarse scale.</p>
<p>0 = didn't attempt or very very wrong, </p>
<p>2 = got started and made some progress, but went off in the wrong direction or with no clear direction, </p>
<p>5 = right direction and got half-way there, </p>
<p>8 = mostly right but a minor thing missing or wrong, </p>
<p>10 = 100% correct.</p>
<p>Note: You must justify self-grades of 2, 5 or 8 with a comment. Grades of 0 and 10 do not need to be justified. If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on Piazza. This is not supposed to be a stressful process. </p>
<p>Course readers are going to be grading and sending you occasional comments. Because we have reader grades, we will catch any attempts at trying to inflate your own scores. This will be considered cheating and is definitely not worth the risk. Your own scores will be used in computing your final grade for the course, adjusted by taking into account reader scores so that everyone is fairly graded effectively on the same scale. For example, if we notice that you tend to give yourself 5s on questions where readers looking at your homeworks tend to give you 8s, we will apply an upward correction to adjust.</p>
<p><b><u>Your self-grades will be due on the following Friday after the homework deadline at 11:00 PM sharp.</b></u> <b><u>We will accept late self-grades up to 25 hours late (Saturday 11:59PM) for a 10% penalty on the associated homework assignment.</b></u> If you don't enter a proper grade by this deadline, you are giving yourself a zero on that assignment. Merely doing the homework is not enough, you must do the homework; turn it in on time; read the solutions; do the self-grade; and turn it in on time. <b><u>Unless all of these steps are done, you will get a zero for that assignment.</b></u><b><u> </b></u></p>
<h3>Exam Policies</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="exams"></a>
<p>The 127/227AT Spring 2020 semester will have one midterm and one final. The midterm time will be during class hours and date will be communicated in class. Current schedule (below) is TENTATIVE. The final will be held during the designated final exam slot released by campus. <b>Makeup/alternate exams will not be scheduled under any circumstances.</b></p>
<p>Please plan for exams at these times and <b><a href="mailto:ee127227sp20@gmail.com,ranade@eecs.berkeley.edu?subject=EECS%20127%20Exam%20Conflict">email us</a>email us</a> during the first two weeks of the semester per university policy if you know about any exam conflicts.</b> If an emergency arises that conflicts with the exam times, email us as soon as possible at ee127227sp20@gmail.com. Emergency exam conflicts will be handled on a case-by-case basis. We do not provide specific accommodations for conflict with other classes, conflict with personal activities, even planned in advance, extracurricular or not. We try to accommodate situations of personal hardship to the best of our abilities.</p>
<h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="gradeBreak"></a>
<p>The course grade will be based on the following evaluation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Homework (30%)</li>
	<li>Midterm (30%)</li>
	<li>Final (40%)</li>
</ul>
<p>There will also be a project option.  If you choose to do the project, we will calculate the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Homework (30%)</li>
	<li>Project (10%)</li>
	<li>Midterm (25%)</li>
	<li>Final (35%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your final grade will be the maximum of the two grading schemes.</p>
<p>This policy rewards consistency and regular work, as well as final knowledge acquisition. </p>
<p><b>Redemption policy: </b>Exams cover all material until the exam. Grade of midterm will be replaced with a weighted average of the final and midterm grade if it is higher: </p>
<ul class="small">
    <li>Clobbered midterm grade = max(midterm grade, 60% final grade + 40% midterm grade)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Schedule</b></p>
<p>The following schedule is TENTATIVE. It will be modified throughout the semester. Reading are provided in the table for the convenience of the students, however it is strongly recommended to read the entire book throughout the chapter. </p>

</ol>

<h3>Course Communication</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="communication"></a>
<p><b>The instructors and TAs will post announcements, clarifications, hints, etc. </b><b>on </b><b><u>Piazza</b></u><b>.</b>You must check the EECS127/227A Piazza page frequently throughout the term.</p>
<p>If you have a question, your best option is to post a message there. The staff will check the forum regularly, and other students will be able to help you too. When using the forum, please avoid off-topic discussions, and please <b>do not post answers to homework questions before the homework is due</b>. Also, always look for a convenient category to post the question to (for example, each homework will have its own category, so please post there). That will ensure you get the answer faster.</p>
<p>If your question is personal or not of interest to other students, you may mark your question as private on Piazza, so only the instructors will see it. If you wish to talk with one of us individually, you are also welcome to come to our office hours. Please reserve email for the questions you can't get answered in office hours, in discussion sections, or through the forum.</p>
<p>It can be challenging for the instructors to gauge how smoothly the class is going. We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. <b>If you would like to send any feedback, you can send email to: </b><u>eecs127staff@gmail.com</u></p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="collaboration"></a>
<p>We encourage you to work on homework problems in study groups of two to four people; however, you must <b>always </b>write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your writeup, and you may never copy material verbatim. <b>Using previous homework and exam solutions is strictly prohibited, and will be considered academic dishonesty. This is not how you want to start your career as an engineer.</b></p>
<p>We expect that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we encourage strongly. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize the subject matter. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with, or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. This is good scholarly conduct.</p>
<h3>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="help"></a>
<p>Are you struggling? Please come talk with us! The earlier we learn about your struggles, the more likely it is that we can help you. Waiting until right before an exam or the last few weeks of the semester to let us know about your problems is not an effective strategy - the later it is, the less we will be able to help you.</p>
<p>Even if you are convinced that you are the only person in the class who is struggling, please overcome any feelings of embarrassment or guilt, and come ask for help as soon as you need it – we can almost guarantee you're not the only person who feels this way. Don't hesitate to ask us for help – we really do care that you thrive!</p>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<a class="anchor" id="advice"></a>
<p>The following tips are offered based on our experience.</p>
<p><b>Do the homework! </b>The homework is explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. There is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and final grades in the class.</p>
<p><b>Keep up with lectures! </b>Discussion sections, labs and homework all touch on portions of what we discuss in lecture.<b>Students do much better if they stay on track with the course.</b>That will also help you keep the pace with your homework and study group.</p>
<p><b>Take part to discussion sections! </b>Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to benefit from it.</p>
<p><b>Come to office hours! </b>We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the material better.</p>
<p><b>Form study groups!</b>As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homework and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. Also recall the caveat above, that you must write up your solutions on your own. We strongly advise you to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get you in practice for the exams. <b>Make sure you work through all problems yourself</b>, and that your final write-up is your own. Some groups try to split up the problems ("you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap notes"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a lot less from this course.</p>
